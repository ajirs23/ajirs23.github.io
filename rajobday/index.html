      OIOII RAJOOOO!!!<br>
      <br>
      HAPPPYY BIRTHDAAAYY MY SISTEERRRR!!<br>
      AAAAAAA I CAN'T BEGIN TO COMPREHEND THAT YOU ARE FINALLY 18 NOWWW!!! OMG THAT'S ACTUALLY SO BIG AND SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH INDEPENDENCE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET NOW THAT YOU ARE FINALLY 18 <br>
      <br>
      Now that we have finally addressed the elephant in the room <span id="no">and truth is if you keep eating so much chicken you'll soon replace that elephant</span> I have a bunch of things that I need to tell you and no idea about from where i should start.
      <br>
      So, let me start off with an apology.  I know I have not been the best friend at times, I haven't really been the friend you deserve, and for that I am genuinely sorry. <br>
      <br>
      You were someone who was with me when I made gifts for all the people close to me - be it Meghna, Rigved as well as Mukund and it's a shame how I never made something huge for you - for one of those people I consider my closest friends. <br>
      <br>
      I had actually planned to give you a better birthday gift, but then things came up, shit went wrong, I procrastinated and and the end we ended up with what you see right now. And it's not really about the birthday gift - it kinda applies to a lot of other things as well. I plan something and it doesn't go as it's planned and then I just destroy it. And I am sorry that you have to be on the receiving end of things like this. <br>
      <br>
      Howwweverrr, don't worrryyy - I have big things planned for you <span id="no">ahem ahem a portfolio website cause the current one looks like shit  ahem ahem</span> so you better be on a lookout for that as soon as our exams get over.<br>
      <br>
      <p id="align"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/743635070102798348/830494314299392000/hhNF0tRbF6fium6-6-xtx5qS0JXR0HlEx8DjxuH_qDFiW3tddla_xV3q-dep_fwuEi6aF-K5v_80Ib06bMZIdagop3dsBAn9JR8P.png" alt="us1" width="50%"></p>
      Yanao, how we'd call ourselves "the weirdest part of this weird world" - to an extent that we also have a server called "w e i r d" - well truth is our friendship started in a pretty odd way as well. It was so random and so out of the blue - how we bonded over you going to the BITM robotics camp and how we used to talk a lot in 8th grade <span id="no">about youuuurrrr bessssttt frieenddd sreeejitaa ;b</span> to how I blocked you at some point because you were so annoying to the point where you were the only school mate I talked to EVERY DAY for the last two years - we really went a full circle, huh? <br>
      <br>
      And while that might not mean a lot to a lot of people - to me it does cause it signifies that no matter what, at the end we always end up sorting out things between us no matter how different our thoughts and ideas might be, no matter how long we have gone without talking - you're always someone I can just go back to whenever I want to and you'll accept me with open arms <span id="no">as long as I let you have my lunch</span> and for that I'm really grateful. <br>
      <br>
      Talking about grateful, I actually have a bunch of things to thank you for. Thank you for being the most brutally honest person I have ever known - from critiquing my music to my artwork to my websites - if there's one person I can bank on for a dead honest review, it's you. And I might have hated you for being so honest at that moment, but I always end up realizing how much those have helped me grow. <br>
      <br>
      Thank you for being someone I can trust with my whole life. I really don't think I have been able to trust anyone as much before you orchestrated into my life <span id="no">don't mind if the word doesn't fit in, i just wanted a musical reference okiii?</span>. When I say that I can trust you with anything, I really mean it and that's probably why you know more about me than even my parents do - I can tell you anything without the fear of being judged or the secret being spilled and I can't even begin to emphasize on how rare you are in those regards - so thank you for that. <br>
      <br>
      Thank you for always being by my side and having faith in me - even when I didn't. You seem to have a oddly massive trust on me and my capabilities - one that I can't even imagine to have. You are often happier than I am when I win a contest or score well <span id="no">yeah that's totally because you get another kfc treat for each good thing I accomplish</span>. You are someone who has been a pillar made out of steel when I was at my lowest - making me laugh like a maniac in the middle of a fcking panic attack. So, chicken buckets aside, thank you for being someone who's always there's to share my happiness and miseries - it really means a lot. <br>
      <br>
      <p id="align"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/743635070102798348/830494340589420575/6MZTtLjK8kIPRXBbtCbC5tyd3CiVYZSySct_Kfoc7Gigjni2KCFnXNrk1p8w9ggDNVjNZIR6jKRHH7ZIqGaURGgXW3oxkG9suafq.png" alt="us2" width="50%"></p>
      There are a bunch of remarkable moments that come to my mind - like me assuming that you might just be my first gay (and by that I mean literally homosexual) friend to finding out that you already have a girlfriend, us musicing together - sending song recommendations almost every day, us playing rocket league together and me being an absolute amazing player, us joking about how "No one loves me" to me telling you about Mukund, us trying to figure out music together and having jam sessions during the lunch break, having over ambitious plans about Google Science Fairs and coming up with ideas that can potentially change the word to just constantly teasing Soham for his amazing indentation - and for all those moments of joy and laughter - thank you and I hope we have more such moments together in the future. <span id="no">that is if you remember me after becoming a grammy winning producer</span> <br>
      <br>
      I have often felt that people just be-friend me for notes, they treat me like google and forget me as soon as they get the answers they need - but you weren't one of them and I probably can't express how glad I am that you aren't one of them.<br>
      <br>
      I know the path you're heading towards can be risky, but if there's one person I can probably imagine being on the Grammy stage receiving an award or the Oscar stage for that matter for being such a drama king it's you. You are one of the most courageous souls I have seen - not afraid to make a path of your own no matter how many obstructions there might be, and if there's any moment when things seem to get too tough - you know you will always have me cheering on you from the sidelines and you can always count on me.<br>
      <br>

      Here's to a year of making memories and lot's of new music, here's to a year of new found freedom, here's to a year of carving our own paths, here's to a year of earning money - HAPPY 18 RAJO! (‚úø‚óï‚Äø‚óï‚úø) I love you <span id="no">as a friend</span>.<br>
