        Heyyyyy Meghnaaaaaaaaaaaaa<br>
        <br>
        When I say that it feels like I have known your forever, I really mean it, from 6 months to 18 years and still going strong, 
        pretty amazing huh?<br>
        <br>
        Right before we go into the more light-hearted part, I'd just like to take a moment to tell you to pause and see how amazing 
        of a person you have become cause I really don't think you do that enough and today, when you finally become an adult, 
        I want you to realize that😡<br>
        <br>
        From being the friend that I don't think most of us deserve, to being the responsible student that eveyone banks on, you do 
        all of those, and you do all of those perfectly!!! <br>
        <br>
        And I know I never say this, but seeing you grow and become the person that you are today, especially over the last year was 
        truly amazing and honestly a bliss, something that I enjoyed every minute of <br>
        <br>
        I know we were not as close for a certain time period, and I know you have been through some extremely tough times, and I 
        regret not being by your side at that instance, but I am here now, and I want you to know I will never leave you or let 
        you go - this bond stays from our birth to our death, okay?? <br>

        Right, enough of the very serious part <br>
        <br>
        Now the fun part🌞<br>
        <br>
        Meeegggggghhhh thank you for being the best friend, the best classmate, (the best second mother?) and overall one of my 
        favorite people to spend time with <br>
        <br>
        It's still ridiculous thinking that I have known you for more than 17 years, and I know that we will know each other forever!
        Pwomiiseee?🥺 <br>
        <br>
        I love how we might not talk for months, but everytime we do so, it feels like home, we catch up on everything that has been
        going on in each other's lives (and other people's lives) and our conversations seem to go on forever <br>
        <br>
        It's funny how we don't talk to each other, and when we do, there's no stopping<br>
        <br>
        I think both of us grew closer and grew a lot last year <br>
        <br>
        And I genuinly enjoyed every moment we spent together, every time we went to school together, every time I had to finish 
        the chicken from your biriyani, every time I had to slow down my pace of eating while trying to stay in pace with you and 
        just every moment we were together <br>
        <br>
        It sucks that we couldn't spend a lot of time together this year, but don't worry, the first time we meet after all this 
        bullshit is over, we make it a point to have biriyani, okkiiii?? <br>
        <br>
        I love you a lot and thank you for being the amazing friend and person that you are <br>
        <br>
        I miss talking to you, SO WE NEED TO CALL AND CATCH UP ON EACH OTHER LIVES SOON OKKIIII <span id="no">dorjar baire biriyanir packet 
        niye dariye achi</span> <br>
        <br>
        I hate that I can't be with you right now to give you a gift and your birthday bashes in person, but we make up for that 
        soon and I can't wait to meet you and just spend time with you again <br>
        <br>
        Hope 18 treats you amazingly and I want you to always know that even when everyone seems to have left your side, I 
        will be there okaayyyyy <br>
        <br>
        LOVEEEE YOUUUUU MAAAAAAAAA <br>
